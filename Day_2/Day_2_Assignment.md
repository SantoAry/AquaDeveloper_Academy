# Day 2 Assignment
Create GitHub repository using git for AquaDeveloper Batch 2 Wave 2 assignments

## Initialization
First, create directory in local machine by mkdir.

```bash
mkdir Academy
```

Since this Day_2_Assignment.md is commited in Day_2.

```bash
cd Academy
mkdir Day_2
```
In directory ../Academy/ we initialize git by git init.

```bash
git init
```
As a result ../Academy/ folder will have a hidden folder called .git as seen below
